## Implementation Status

Only very few options of nix2container are currently supported.

## Example

```nix
{
  # Provide builders for all systems of your flake
  perSystem = {
    # `imageSystem`, `imagePkgs` automatically refer to the target architecture 
    # of your image.
    # By default, the corresponding Linux platform for Darwin/Mac OS.
    n2c.images.basic = {imageSystem, imagePkgs, ...}: {
      imageConfig = {
        # As usual with nix, all dependencies are included automatically.
        # But you can also explicitly decide what to put into which layer!
        entrypoint = ["${imagePkgs.hello}/bin/hello"];
      };
    };
  };
}
```

### Run

Build and run it in docker:

```console
❯ nix run .\#n2c.aarch64-darwin.images.basic.do.run.interactivelyInDocker
❯ nix run .\#n2c.x86_64-linux.images.basic.do.run.interactivelyInDocker
... other architectures ...
```

Or podman:

```console
❯ nix run .\#n2c.aarch64-darwin.images.basic.do.run.interactivelyWithPodman
❯ nix run .\#n2c.x86_64-linux.images.basic.do.run.interactivelyWithPodman
... other architectures ...
```
